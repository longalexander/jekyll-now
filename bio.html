<h2>Bio</h2>
<div class="infobox">
  <p>Iâ€™m a student expecting to graduate from <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a> in June 2019 with a B.S. in 
    <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu">Symbolic Systems</a>. 

  <p>This website primarily exists because I've found that writing down, and revisiting, wisdom helps keeps me on the straight and narrow.</p>

  <p>I also plan to use this site as a repository for teaching materials but that's a work in progress.</p>

  <p>Best,
  <br>Alex</br></p>
