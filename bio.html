<h2>Bio</h2>
<div class="infobox">
  <p>I'm responsible for <a href="https://www.speedyopt.com">SpeedyOPT.com</a>. SpeedyOPT makes it easier for international students in the U.S. to apply for work authorization.</p>
  
  <p>I love taking ideas from conception to reality. There's something magical about nurturing thoughts into actionable ideas, navigating the strategy maze, and delivering a sustained, impactful experience. If you examine how I've chosen to spend my time, I think you'll find that this is the theme that unites everything.</p>
 
  <p>This website primarily exists because I've found that writing down, and revisiting, wisdom helps keeps me on the straight and narrow.</p>

  <p>Best,
  <br>Alex</br></p>
