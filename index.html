  <p>"If you’re building a flying vehicle, you can’t cut any corners. If you do, it’s going to be an illusion that it’s going to make it faster. … You have to do it step by step, but you do want to do it ferociously."</p>

  "When I see a violation of this principle I don't think of that as an opportunity...I don't say "oh good an opportunity to make a product, an opporunity to start a business, an opportunity to do research"... I see a tragedy. It feels like an injustice. And if I think that there's anything I can do about, I feel as if it is my responsibility to do so. Not opportunity, but responsibility."
