<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this page, "principles" are defined to be: rules that help me make decisions by 
  illuminating a clearer distinction between what I believe to be right and wrong.</p>

<p>I am occasionally lucky enough to discover principles which make my life easier. 
  You may attempt to use them in your own life, but I must warn you that they may not work because they were designed
  to suit my needs at a particular time and place.</p>

<h4>Choosing Classes</h4>

<p>I attend a university where I have a lot of freedom in the classes I choose to take.</p>

<p>Personally, I try to maximize my ability to learn after college. 
  For me, this means strengthening thinking skills which I believe I will need in the future. 
  University is a perfect place for me to strengthen these skills because I believe that it is important to build 
  good habits while the cost of failure is low and university provides a lot of low cost, high quality resources to 
  support the development of reasoning skills. </p>
  
 <p><strong>Principle</strong>: If you discover that you are weak at a skill which interests you, empowers you and 
  which makes you envy others who possess it, work to develop it.</p>

<h4>Optimizing for Energy</h4>

<p>My fulfillment depends, in part, on my ability to make the right choices. By observation, it seems that I require an adequate store of mental energy in order to make the right choices.</p>

<p>Thus, my life is optimized for maintaining energy. I accept fewer waking hours, in return for more energy.</p> 

<p>Practically, I find optimizing for energy to be a difficult task. I struggle to optimize for energy because it 
  is difficult to keep track of my energy level. It is difficult to keep track of my energy level because my mind and body play tricks on me. 
  When I'm tired, I often don't realize that I'm tired. When I'm tired, my self control weakens.</p> 
  
 <p><strong>Principle</strong>: Live by a daily schedule. On days which force you to break from the schedule, ask yourself: When you wake up tomorrow morning, will your current activity make you feel angry/guilty?</p>
