**Volumes**

My opinions will change over time. Every few years, I will place all the writing that exists at that time in a secure place. This will be a volume of the book. I will then continue to write on the website for another few years until I decide that the time has come to create another volume.

For example, when I am 23 I will take all the writing on this website and put it in a secure place. The writing will be placed in a folder labeled "Long Letters: Volume 1: 21-23 years of age". Then I will continue to write on the website. When I turn 25, I might decide to create another volume. I will then take all the writing on the website and put it in a secure place. The writing will be placed in a folder labeled "Long Letters: Volume 2: 23-25 years of age". I will repeat this process till I have completely stopped writing.
