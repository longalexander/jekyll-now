<h2>Bio</h2>
<div class="infobox">
  <p>Iâ€™m a student expecting to graduate from <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a> in June 2019 with a B.S. in 
    <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu">Symbolic Systems</a>. 

  <p>I believe that life is an adventure. Sometimes, the adventure gets really tough. I am blessed to have been born into a family that emphasizes the importance of wisdom. Practical wisdom has helped me navigate some of the most difficult parts of my adventure. I'm not dependent on wisdom, but it is certainly a fantastic reference that helps decision making.</p>

  <p>I'd like to share the wisdom I've learned to help others on their own adventures. Writing down the wisdom I've learned also helps me to reflect.</p>

  <p>To adventure and fellowship, </p>
  <p>Alex</p>
