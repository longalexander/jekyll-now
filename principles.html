<p>I am occasionally lucky enough to discover principles which make my life easier. You may attempt to use them in your own life, but I must warn you that they may not work because they were designed specifically to suit my needs at a particular time and place.</p>

<h4>Choosing Classes</h4>

<p>I attend a university where I have a lot of freedom in the classes I choose to take.</p>

<p>Personally, I try to maximize my ability to learn after college. For me, this means strengthening thinking skills which I believe I will need in the future. I believe that it is important to build good thinking habits while the cost of failure is low. As a result, I spend my time learning things that I find interesting and useful but am weak at.
