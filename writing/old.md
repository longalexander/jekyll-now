For a long time man was the voice of reason. Man was ultimately rational. He might have small slips in his reasoning, but ultimately he gave every problem a logical analysis. Well, that was the general opinion of the time anyway.
Then, through cognition experiments, it was discovered that Man is, in truth, not as rational as we thought. This is troubling for economists. Rational human beings are an assumption for the majority of economic theories that exist today.
The word rational derives from the latin word ratio which means ‘reckoning’ or ‘reason’. Rational in today’s dictionaries means ‘based on or in accordance with reason or logic’ (Oxford Dictionaries). In Economics, the word ‘rational’ has many different meanings given to it by various economists over the centuries.

***The Perfect Rationalist***

The term ‘Rational Economic Man’ or ‘Homo Economicus’ was created in the late nineteenth century and used as the basis of a number of Economists’ mathematical models. Homo Economicus is constructed on the basis of independence, perfect information and complete rationality. Complete rationality refers to fulfilling our utility function. This means that we aim to maximise our own welfare in any situation that involves choice. An image of a completely selfish superhuman draws parallels to some villains, rather than heroes, on today’s silver screen. Richard Darwin’s view conferred in The Selfish Gene ‘...anything that has evolved by natural selection should be selfish.’ is one rejected by the majority in what appears to be a modern era striving to move away from the ‘survivalist’ agonistic behaviour of past Ages but is also one that may hold much truth.
‘Homo Economicus vs Human Being: Outcomes of Irrationality’ (Yamane, Yoneda and Tsutsui,2012), a paper from Osaka University, examines ‘how irrationality affects the performance (income and happiness) of human beings’. The authors used a questionnaire survey of 4,018 randomly selected respondents from all over Japan and measured their responses to determine their degree of irrationality. Three additional variables for Homo Economicus were identified: Intellectual ability, Selfishness and Self Control. These variables were measured on humans. Humans with higher values for these three variables were noted as being more similar to Homo Economicus than their peers. The paper, while admitting that it is limited, concluded that ‘Homo Economicus achieves higher performance than other subspecies of humanity’. Should economics students thus be taught how to be rational so as to emulate this predicted higher performance and achieve higher levels of welfare?
Attempting to attain such a high level of rationality would require much greater use of some parts of the brain and faster neurone transmissions. Research into brainwaves has shown that when we reason or think logically at normal or heightened consciousness, electrical information is transferred at between about 14 to 40 Hz. Waves between these frequencies are called Beta waves. Beta waves are also known to contribute to higher levels of stress and anxiety. The Journal of Psychopharmacology reported in 2013 that over eight million people suffer from anxiety disorders every year at a cost of £9.8billion to the country (inclusive of treatment and lost productivity). Increasingly demanding work and use of high function brain processes by almost all sectors, as manual work becomes progressively automated, has closely correlated with rapidly increasing
numbers of sufferers from stress-related illness. It appears apparent that there is a sensible reason behind our natural irrationalities. A balance of rational and irrational decision making might be best for our long term health and ultimately, welfare.
Altruistic actions, ‘selfless concern for the wellbeing of others’ (Oxford Dictionary), make us feel good. We feel good when we are generous. Being generous is a pleasurable action. Sex is also pleasurable. Perhaps this is nature’s way of encouraging us? In fact, while a degree of egocentrism is only natural to ensure our basic survival, altruism has been a basis of our progression as a species. Stefan Klein, author of ‘Survival of the Nicest’ puts it best. ‘
Ultimately, Homo Economicus is an unrealistic target to base a core curriculum syllabus on because of man’s natural genetic makeup. Man is unable to physically and mentally make decisions with perfect rationality continuously. Decision fatigue shows this quite clearly. A study on judicial decisions demonstrates decision fatigue (Danziger, Levav and Avnaim-Pesso, 2011).
In the above diagram, dotted lines show meal times. It is quite clearly demonstrated that chances of parole are greatly reduced the longer a convict has to wait after meal times to be seen by a Judge. Judges are shown to be less and less rational as the number of consecutive decisions they have to make increases.
In addition to decision fatigue, another social psychological discovery is that of ego depletion. Ego depletion ‘refers to the
 humans who cooperated in groups, and with survival more assured, our altruistic ancestors were
he goes on to say ‘We humans became first the friendliest and then the most intelligent apes’.
Natural selection favoured those early
  free to devote brainpower to developing intelligence, language, and culture—our very humanity’ ,
  Following this thought, a completely selfish human being, invested in his own utility, would
 ultimately be detrimental to society’s progress. It would not be sensible, looking at a long term
 stance, to mimic the selfishness of Rational Economic Man.
  idea that self-control or willpower draw upon a limited pool of mental
 resources that can be used up’ (Wikipedia). In an experiment (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven and
 Tice, 1998) volunteers were offered chocolate then asked to solve a difficult puzzle. Those
 volunteers that resisted the temptation to consume the chocolate were less willing and able to
 persevere on the difficult puzzle. The evidence behind ego depletion seems to suggest that humans
 are currently naturally incapable of maintaining self control consistently. This inherent lack of self
 control would render a human of the current Age incapable of making continuous rational,
 independent and fully informed decisions.
 The perfect rationalist or Rational Economic Man is quite clearly an unrealistic target for modern
 humans. A syllabus compiled with Homo Economicus in mind would be unpopular in increasingly
 altruistic times and incompatible with our inherent cognitive shortcomings. These cognitive
 shortcomings also question the validity of Economics’ most popular model of rationality.
The model Rationalist
Another definition of rational behaviour refers to rational choice theory. This refers to the idea that humans merely consider the costs and benefits of all decisions rather than act as perfect beings who choose outright the option that will maximise one’s own utility. It is the theory that underlines almost all of today’s economic theories.
In 2008 the Global Financial Crisis shocked the world. Interestingly enough, Wikipedia documents thirty seven financial crises (of various scales) since the beginning of the 19th Century. That equates to a financial crisis about approximately every 5.8 years. Perhaps we shouldn’t have been so shocked. Some economists see the problem as man’s irrationality. In its simplest form, Economics is all about allocating resources to satisfy everyone’s unlimited wants. However, it is very difficult to allocate efficiently and effectively when people act irrationally. Their decisions cannot be quantitatively modelled and as a result cannot be precisely insured against. Economic systems and theories cannot ‘prepare for’ irrational humans because of their unpredictability. For instance, the dotcom crisis of 2000-2001 saw what Alan Greenspan described as ‘irrational exuberance’. While this may be a slight exaggeration, people were buying speculatively into anything with ‘.com’ after its name rather than well balanced balance sheets as would have been rational. For the majority of people, financial crises are quite simply not good for human welfare. Take for example, a study by the University of Oxford
 and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine looking at suicide
 rates in the US, Canada and 24 EU countries. They noted 7,950 more suicides in Europe, 240 more in
 Canada and 4,750 more in the US than expected by extrapolation in the five years following the 2008
 Global Financial Crisis. It seems economically and socially sensible to teach future generations how
 to be rational as we seek to leave behind the turmoil of financial crashes. In fact, it does appear that
 we are becoming increasingly rational. The last set of large scale economic crises occurred eight
 years apart. The great gap in time even led Gordon Brown to mistakenly announce that ‘we today in
 our country have economic stability not boom and bust’.
 
 A great deal of our learning, not just in Economics, is intended to overcome natural human
 tendencies. For example, referring back to ego depletion, we have self control but find it difficult to
 employ at all times. Going to school and partaking in activities helps us learn how to overcome
 temptation. We study for exams and train hard on the sports pitch because we see long term
 benefits. We learn how to force ourselves to skip a TV show and study instead. The same principle
 occurs in less economically developed countries. A hunter might have to employ self control and
 patience while waiting to kill his dinner. Thus economics students should be taught to be rational
 just as we are taught to persevere through times of hardship. Such perseverance is part of our
 historical progress; even the Neanderthals of ancient times had to overcome natural tendencies to
 be egocentric and practice altruism to ensure their long term survival.

 On the other hand, we may be simply unable to overcome our irrationality. We posses numerous
 cognitive biases of which not all have been proven yet. Cognitive biases are natural tendencies to
 process information in certain ways. For example, the cognitive bias ‘Focalism’ shows us that we
 tend to over-rely on one piece of information when making a decision. This is irrational. However,
 there is no proven way of mitigating this bias or, in fact, any cognitive bias. There may be a reason
 behind this. Irrationality and cognitive biases may be an inherent part of our survival instincts. Daniel
 Kahneman, widely regarded as one of the founding father of behavioural economics, explains that
 the brain has two systems in his book ‘Thinking, Fast and Slow’. System 1 is used to make quick,
 almost instantaneous decisions and System 2 is used to make slower, more logical decisions. Both
 are useful in their own way. However, in System 1 there is simply not enough time to
 comprehensively consider the costs and benefits of all decisions. The decision between flight and
 fight could be life saving and to ensure survival, there is not time for a slowly considered, logical
 choice. A bias towards rationality may just not be intended for human beings.
 
 ***Conclusion***
 
 Firstly, it appears that while humans are able to make rational decisions, we are at the same time
 naturally irrational. As a result, it is unlikely that Economics students will be able to be taught how to
 be completely rational. We have a situation where the rationality potential we posses is ‘bounded
 rationality’. They can only be taught how to be slightly more rational as they are constrained by
 heuristics. Educators will have to be rational themselves when considering whether the benefits of a
 marginally more rational population will outweigh the costs of teaching that rationality.
 Secondly, the idea of rational irrationality made mainstream by economist Bryan Caplan has its own
 part to play in this debate. Rational irrationality describes the idea that a demand curve exists for
 irrationality. Very simply, if the cost of irrationality is low, there will be higher demand for it. The
 cost of irrationality appears to be rising. Financial crises are more infrequent, but occur on greater
 scales as growing economies become more challenging to manage. Careless irrationality now holds
 greater consequences and as a result demand for irrational behaviour following Caplan’s endorsed
 theory is likely to fall. Thus it appears logical that students should be taught how to be rational in
 order to compete with their fellow man for survival and ensure society’s progress.
 Finally, there have been huge changes and developmental leaps forward around the world. Steven
 Pinker’s book ‘The Better Angels of Our Nature’ demonstrates to readers the declining violence in
 the world. Mortality rates have fallen significantly around the world. The number of people in
 extreme poverty has been reduced from 1.9billion to 1.2 billion in the last 20 years. Surviving on
 earth appears to be becoming easier. Perhaps our survival instincts will then decline and our
 tendency for irrationality weaken as we adapt to the times. Perhaps we will become naturally more
 rational and there will be natural mitigation of survivalist cognition. Should we choose to follow this
 concept of adaptation, economics students should be taught how to rational so they will be better
 equipped to survive in an increasingly rational world. Given the degree to which we have adapted
 since the time of Denisova Hominin at the dawn of mankind it appears likely that we will adapt to
 suit current trends. A new question regarding the time frame by which implementation of
 ‘rationality lessons’ occurs has appeared.
