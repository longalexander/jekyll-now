I’m a student at <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a> expected to graduate in June 2019 with a B.S. in <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu">Symbolic Systems</a>. I've lived in the United States, the United Kingdom and Malaysia. Most recently, I worked at the <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/">Human Computer Interaction</a> lab on campus.

I love the feeling that clarity brings. I like spending time helping others feel this too. Striving for clear thinking is central to who I am. It can be time and energy consuming in the short term, but I am placing bets on the long term.

Time with family and friends makes me happy. I also enjoy regularly reading The Daily Mail, struggling through problem sets and code, satiating curiosity about the environments we build, watching commercials, listening to Blue Planet II, grappling with difficult concepts, writing clearly and learning about the people I meet.

I collect wisdom I'd like to share with my future children. Please click <a href="http://www.longletters.com">here</a> if this interests you.

I’ve been told I’m friendly and I’m happy to help so do get in touch if you'd like :). 

Alex
