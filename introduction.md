**Introduction**

Long Letters is an online collection of my writing, past projects and bio.

In January 2018 I decided that regularly writing my thoughts down might be a good way of maintaining clarity in my life. I enjoy writing clearly and I love reading clear writing.

Almost ten years before, I had read and watched The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch. Randy was a father, a husband and a Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. He was diagnosed with terminal cancer in September 2017 and told that he had 3-6 months to live. Just a month later, he presented a lecture called "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams". This lecture came to be known as 'The Last Lecture' and was also published as a book.

Randy Pausch only had a month to summarize his thoughts and ideas into The Last Lecture. He included in his lecture what he thought would be most valuable for his children.

I've been blessed with more time. For as long as I live, I hope to write clearly about things I think will be valuable for my (future) children.

By focusing on the things that I think are valuable enough to explain to my (future) children, I hope to develop a clear understanding of the things that matter most to me.

I hypothesize that this exercise will hone my ability to approach life with clarity. Should this happen, I hope that I can use this gift to assist others.

This website is available for anyone to visit. I don't anticipate many people will visit, but I hope that those who do enjoy themselves :).

**Volumes**

My opinions will change over time. Every few years, I will place all the writing that exists at that time in a secure place. This will be a volume of the book. I will then continue to write on the website for another few years until I decide that the time has come to create another volume.

For example, when I am 23 I will take all the writing on this website and put it in a secure place. The writing will be placed in a folder labeled "Long Letters: Volume 1: 21-23 years of age". Then I will continue to write on the website. When I turn 25, I might decide to create another volume. I will then take all the writing on the website and put it in a secure place. The writing will be placed in a folder labeled "Long Letters: Volume 2: 23-25 years of age". I will repeat this process till I have completely stopped writing.

**Origins**

When I was a child, my mother and I would talk about writing a book some day in the future. It would be a book about the lessons she taught me. I think that it is likely that the idea for this website stemmed from those talks. So, my mother deserves credit for the creation of this website.
