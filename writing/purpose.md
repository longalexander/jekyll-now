**Purpose**

"What is my purpose in life?" is a question that some people ask. As far as I can tell at this early stage of my life, it seems common among people who do not endure a daily struggle to survive (eat/seek shelter etc). In my limited but privilieged experience at elite schools and universities, I have encountered many people with this question. 

It is a question that can really paralyze one person and hardly seem to bother another.

This chapter includes ideas on purpose from people I've had a chance to encounter through books, interviews, video, in-person etc.

***A principle divides the world into right and wrong***

Core Insight: A principle is a divider - it is an idea that helps people divide the world into right and wrong.

Context: Someone might ask you what your personal mission statement or goal is. 

Below are some additional examples.

-------------------------
Directional Thought e.g.  Creators need powerful tools

vs

Directly Actionable Insight (Principle)  e.g. Creators need an immediate connection to their products (seeing their product changing form, not like code compiling then running each time). (If there is an immediate connection, good. If there is not an immediate connect, I need to go and fix it).

-------------------------

Another example.

Case Study: Larry Tesler, famous for many contributions to Computer Science including "cut/copy/paste" and modeless text editors.

Directional Thought e.g. "I want to make software simpler."

vs 

Directly Actionable Insight (Principle) e.g. "No modes" (if a person is working in different modes then that is wrong and I will fix that).
