**Purpose**

"What is my purpose in life?" is a question that some people ask. As far as I can tell, it is common among people who do not endure a daily struggle to survive (eat/seek shelter etc). In my limited but privilieged experience at elite schools and universities, I have encountered many people with this question. 

It is a question that, when given to two people who have grown up in similar cultures, can really paralyze one person and hardly seem to bother the other.

This chapter includes ideas on purpose from people I've had a chance to encounter through books, interviews, video, in-person etc.

***A principle divides the world into right and wrong***

Core Insight: A principle is a divider - it is an idea that helps people divide the world into right and wrong.

Context: Someone might ask you what your mission statement or goal is. For example, you might say "I believe people need food to survive". For some, this is less actionable or empowering than "People need food to be accessible whenever they get hungry." 

Below are some additional examples.

-------------------------
Directional Thought e.g.  Creators need powerful tools

vs

Directly Actionable Insight (Principle)  e.g. Creators need an immediate connection to their products (seeing their product changing form, not like code compiling then running each time). (If there is an immediate connection, good. If there is not an immediate connect, I need to go and fix it).

Another example.

Case Study: Larry Tesler

Directional Thought e.g. I want to make software simpler

vs 

Directly Actionable Insight (Principle) e.g. No modes (if person is working in different modes then that is wrong and has to change.
