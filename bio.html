<h2>Bio</h2>
<div class="infobox">
  <p>I’m a student expecting to graduate from <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a> in June 2019 with a B.S. in 
    <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu">Symbolic Systems</a>. 
    Last summer, I worked at the <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/">Human Computer Interaction</a> lab on campus.

  <p>I think that I am happiest when I am cared for, and when I care for others. I believe that when I care for someone, at minimum, I experience engrossment in that person to the extent that their fears become my own. I try to focus my life and work on caring for others.</p>

  <p>I love the feeling that clarity brings. I like spending time helping others feel this too. Striving for clear thinking is central to who I am. It can be time and energy consuming in the short term, but I am placing bets on the long term.</p>

  <p>Time with family and friends makes me happy. I also enjoy regularly reading The Daily Mail, struggling through problem sets and code, 
    satiating curiosity about the environments we build, watching commercials, listening to powerful music, singing, 
    grappling with difficult concepts, writing clearly and learning about the people I meet. </p>

  <p>I collect wisdom I'd like to share with my future children. Please click <a href="http://www.longletters.com">here</a> 
    if this interests you.</p>
  
  <p>I collect, and continually modify, situation specific principles that are helpful in my own life. Life does not always lend itself to the clear application of principles, but my principles sometimes help to enable improvements I'd like to make.

  <p>I’ve been told I’m friendly and I’m happy to help so do get in touch if you'd like :).</p>
