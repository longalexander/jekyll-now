I’m a student at Stanford University expected to graduate in June 2019 with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems.

I love the feeling that clarity brings. I like spending time helping others feel this too.

Time with family and friends makes me happy. I also enjoy regularly reading The Daily Mail, struggling through problem sets and code, watching commercials, grappling with difficult concepts, writing clearly and listening to the stories of people I meet.

Please do get in touch. I’ve been told I’m friendly and I’m happy to help.
