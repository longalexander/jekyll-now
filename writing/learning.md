**Learning**

Without thinking, everyone is constantly learning. However, the intensity, focus, style and purpose of learning differs between individuals. There are convincing reasons to believe that these differences may affect people's life outcomes. 

Personalizing and optimizing one's learning may be difficult because it is difficult to predict how current practices evolve into future consequences. Consulting those who have journeyed through life in ways that you might intuitively deem successful or unsuccessful is a method of determining the way in which you wish to conduct your learning.

This chapter includes ideas on learning from people I've had a chance to encounter through books, interviews, video, in-person etc.

***Step by step, ferociously.***
Core Insight: Learning happens one moment at a time. 

Context: Jeff Bezos talking about his rocket company: "If you’re building a flying vehicle, you can’t cut any corners. If you do, it’s going to be an illusion that it’s going to make it faster. … You have to do it step by step, but you do want to do it ferociously."

-------------------------
You have to put one foot in front of the other. Things take time. You can't skip steps. There are no shortcuts. But you want to do those steps with passion and ferocity.

***Build a house: Learn for mastery***
Core Insight: Learning is like building a house. You don't want to be building on a broken foundation.

Context: Sal Khan popularized the idea of learning for mastery. At every step of the learning process there should be no gaps in learning. Leaving gaps in learning is an absurd idea. One way to understand this absurdity is by drawing an analogy to building a house. If you were building a house and the foundation was not completely solid, would you build the next floor? Finishing secondary/high school education takes around 12 years. Would you want to live in a 12-storey building where each floor below you had cracks?
