  <p>I'm a Software Engineer at <a href='https://workwhilejobs.com/' target='_blank'>WorkWhile Jobs</a>. We're building an online marketplace that makes hourly labor on-demand and scalable for employers while providing workers with stable income and unmatched benefits. This will be a totally new way for lower-skilled workers to earn a better living and live better lives. When we succeed, our impact will be measured in GDP growth.</p>
  
  <p>I think that what we're doing at WorkWhile significantly changes people's lives for the better. If this is interesting to you, I'd be more than happy to give you a call or, if you're in San Francisco, meet somewhere convenient for you - my contact details are below. 
 
  <p>This website primarily exists as a repository of quotes that I've found to be particularly eye opening. I don't know if they actually impact my life, but it makes me feel good when I read them.</p>

  <p>I love taking ideas from conception to reality. There's something magical about the process: nurturing thoughts into actionable ideas, navigating the strategy maze, returning undercooked ideas to the stove, struggling through different approaches, and cooking up a sustained, impactful experience.</p>
