  <p>"If you’re building a flying vehicle, you can’t cut any corners. If you do, it’s going to be an illusion that it’s going to make it faster. … You have to do it step by step, but you do want to do it ferociously."</p>
  <p><i>-Jeff Bezos, on Blue Origin</i></p>
  <hr>
  <p>"I always think about the billions of pieces that are locked in billions of heads...all kinds of ideas...these are ideas that must be grown. And without an environment in which they can grow...many of these ideas will not emerge or they will emerge stunted."</p>
  <p><i>-Bret Victor, Inventing on Principle</i></p>

  <p>"Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men (and women)."</p>
  <p><i>-Horace Mann</i></p>

  <p>"I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines.
    They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and boy does that help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you."</p>
  <p><i>-Charlie Munger</i></p>

  <p>"The life of Darwin demonstrates how a turtle may outrun the hares, aided by extreme objectivity, which helps the objective person 
    end up like the only player without a blindfold in a game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey."</p>
  <p><i>-Charlie Munger</i></p>

  <p>"I saw more of Lyell than any other man both before and after my marriage. His mind was characterized, as it appeared to me, by 
    clearness, caution, sound judgement and a good deal or originality. When I made any remark to him on Geology, he never rested until 
    he saw the whole case clearly and often made me see it more clearly than I had done before. He would advance all possible objections 
    to my suggestion; and even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious."</p>

  "When I see a violation of this principle I don't think of that as an opportunity...I don't say "oh good an opportunity to make a product, an opporunity to start a business, an opportunity to do research"... I see a tragedy. It feels like an injustice. And if I think that there's anything I can do about, I feel as if it is my responsibility to do so. Not opportunity, but responsibility."
  <p><i>-Bret Victor, Inventing on Principle</i></p>

  "Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets - and can be lost in a heartbeat."

  "It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong."

  "I'm not entitled to have an opinion unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people who are in the 
  opposition."
  <p><i>-Charlie Munger</i></p>

  "Well structured, narrative text is what we're after rather than just text. If someone builds a list of bullet points in word, that 
  would be just as bad as powerpoint. The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than "writing" a 20 page powerpoint is because 
  the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how 
  things are related. Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative 
  importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas."
  <p><i>-Jeff Bezos, on removing PowerPoint from Amazon</i></p>

  "If you were to critique your own memo, what are the strongest arguments against your recommendations?"

  "You can hold a ballet, and that can be successful. You can hold a rock concert, and that can be successful. 
  Just don't hold a ballet and advertise it as a rock concert."
