<h2>Bio</h2>
<div class="infobox">
  <p>I'm responsible for <a href="https://www.speedyopt.com">SpeedyOPT.com</a>. SpeedyOPT makes it easier for international students in the U.S. to apply for work authorization.</p>
  
  <p>I love taking ideas from conception to reality. There's something magical about nurturing thoughts into actionable ideas, navigating the strategy maze, returning undercooked ideas to the stove, struggling through different approaches, and cooking up a sustained, impactful experience.</p>
 
  <p>This website primarily exists because I've found that writing down, and revisiting, wisdom helps keeps me on the straight and narrow.</p>

  <p>Best,
  <br>Alex</br></p>
