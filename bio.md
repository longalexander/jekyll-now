I’m a student at Stanford University expected to graduate in June 2019 with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems.

I love the feeling that clarity brings. I like spending time helping others feel this too. It can be time and energy consuming in the short term, but I strive for clear thinking.

Time with family and friends makes me happy. I also enjoy regularly reading The Daily Mail, struggling through problem sets and code, watching commercials, listening to Blue Planet II, grappling with difficult concepts, writing clearly and learning about the people I meet.

Please do get in touch - I’ve been told I’m friendly and I’m happy to help :).

#Long Letters

Long Letters is an online collection of my writing, past projects and bio. 

In Januray 2018 I decided to publicise my work and opinions. For reasons, please click [here](http://www.longletters.com/Reasons-why-this-website-was-created/).

I believe that my personal ideas and character are, to a large extent, formed by the people I've grown up around. Any success I receive should be attributed to my mother, father, brother, grandparents, friends, teachers and mentors.
