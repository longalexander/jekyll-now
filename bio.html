  <p>I am an engineer and designer responsible for <a href="https://www.speedyopt.com">SpeedyOPT.com</a>. SpeedyOPT is the quickest and safest way for OPT applicants to complete the I-765 form.</p>

  <p>This website primarily exists because I've found that writing down, and revisiting, wisdom helps keeps me on the straight and narrow.</p>
  
  <!--Consider this: Public companies report their financial results to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings are valuable for company insiders and outsiders. For outsiders, they are the closest things to facts about the companies. For insiders, SEC filings can be a tool for understanding the history of the company and gaining insight into management's decisions. Accounting (the language used to describe businesses) includes new terminology and non-intuitive concepts which means that there is some initial friction to understanding financial statements. For some businesses, friction is increased because Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (i.e. the rules of accounting) don't accurately reflect the state of that business. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are one of these businesses. To help smooth out some of the bumps in the road, I'm writing a guidebook to help beginners understand REIT financial statements. I am using Prologis (NYSE:PLD) as an illustrative case study.--></p>
