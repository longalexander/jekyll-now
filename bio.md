I’m a student at Stanford University expected to graduate in June 2019 with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems.

I love the feeling that clarity brings. I like spending time helping others feel this too. It can be time and energy consuming in the short term, but I strive for all my communication to be clear.

Time with family and friends makes me happy. I also enjoy regularly reading The Daily Mail, struggling through problem sets and code, watching commercials, listening to Blue Planet II, grappling with difficult concepts, writing clearly and learning about the people I meet.

Please do get in touch - I’ve been told I’m friendly and I’m happy to help :).
