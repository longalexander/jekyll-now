**Know when you're tired**

I'm writing this note because I should have gone to bed an hour and a half ago. This is how things often go when I'm tired:

1) I often try to do mentally intensive things but am slow to understand things as I'm tired and should really just go to bed.<br>
2) I stop focusing on the tasks I've prioritised and am easily distracted.<br>
3) The things that distract me keep me up even longer.<br>
4) The next morning I tell myself that I will be better at knowing when I am tired.<br>

This series of events repeats itself when I get very tired. The effects of tiredness compound making the situation worse each time it occurs.

Here's are some possible solutions to the problem that seem to work:

- Have a set, calendared bedtime and make it a habit to stick to it.

- Have a list of things that are productive, but not a priority, that you can do when you're tired. For instance, I'm in a fairly inspirational mood so I'm using the time to codify my thoughts instead of mindlessly scrolling through The Daily Mail for the 3rd time in 15 minutes.
