<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this page, "principles" are defined to be: rules that help me make decisions by 
  illuminating a clearer distinction between what I believe to be right and wrong.</p>

<p>I am occasionally lucky enough to discover situation specific principles which help me make improvements to my life. 
  The list grows slowly because my understanding of life is, at best, minimal.</p>

<div id = "caring_for_others">
  <h4>Caring for others</h4>
  
  <div class = "infobox">
    <p>When thoughts are racing through my head, I find it difficult to concentrate on the person I am interacting with. </p>
    
    <p>Once my thoughts have calmed down, I inevitably relive recent occasions where I've failed to concentrate on the person I'm 
      interacting with. I feel disappointing, grimacing, regret.</p>
    
    <p>I feel regret because I have been in the shoes of the other person. I have interacted with people who were 
      not focused on me and those people made me feel lonely and insignificant. Now, I am the one making someone else feel lonely 
      and insignificant. I think that this is wrong.</p>

    <p>To avoid regret, I am strongly motivated to deliberately practice 'care for others'.</p>
    
    <p>I believe in a particular definition of 'care for others'. DEF: If I care for another person, then I must experience
      engrossment in the other person to the extent that the other person's cares become my own.</p> 
  
    <p><strong>Principle</strong>: If your mind is ablaze with thought, your body taut with stored energy, or the person you're with 
      is just image and sound, pause. Take three slow breaths. Pause. Be conscious of the walls of your mind dissolving. Feel your companion's feelings. 
      Adventure with them.  </p>

<div id = "choosing_classes">
  <h4>Choosing Classes</h4>
  
  <div class = "infobox">

    <p>I try to maximize my ability to learn over the long term. 
      For me, this means strengthening thinking skills which I believe I will support learning I do in the future. 
      I believe that it is important to build good learning habits. By the opinion of those who have come before me, it appears that 
      it is helpful to do so now. Some say it is better to fail early, others ask "why wait to enjoy the benefits of good habits?".</p>
  
    <p><strong>Principle</strong>: If you discover that you are weak at a skill which interests you, empowers you and 
    which makes you envy others who possess it, work to develop it.</p>

<div id = "optimizing_for_energy">
  <h4>Optimizing for Energy</h4>
  <div class = "infobox">
    <p>My fulfillment depends, in part, on my ability to make the right choices. By observation, it seems that I require an adequate store of mental energy in order to make the right choices.</p>

    <p>Thus, in general, my life is optimized for maintaining energy. I accept fewer waking, working or playing hours, in return for more energy.</p> 

    <p>Practically, I find optimizing for energy to be a difficult task. I struggle to optimize for energy because it 
    is difficult to keep track of my energy level. This difficulty arises because my mind and body seem to play tricks on me. 
    When I'm tired, I often don't realize that I'm tired. When I'm tired, my self control weakens.</p> 
  
    <p><strong>Principle</strong>: Live by a daily schedule. On days which force you to break from the schedule, ask yourself: When you wake up tomorrow morning, how will your current activity make you feel?</p>
