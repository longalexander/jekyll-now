<p>For the purposes of this page, "principles" are defined to be: rules that help me make decisions by 
  illuminating a clearer distinction between what I believe to be right and wrong.</p>

<p>I am occasionally lucky enough to discover principles which make my life easier. 
  You may attempt to use them in your own life, but I must warn you that they may not work because they were designed
  to suit my needs at a particular time and place.</p>

<h4>Choosing Classes</h4>

<p>I attend a university where I have a lot of freedom in the classes I choose to take.</p>

<p>Personally, I try to maximize my ability to learn after college. 
  For me, this means strengthening thinking skills which I believe I will need in the future. 
  University is a perfect place for me to strengthen these skills because I believe that it is important to build 
  good habits while the cost of failure is low and university provides a lot of low cost, high quality resources to 
  support the development of reasoning skills. </p>
  
 <p>Principle: If you discover that you are weak at a skill which interests you, empowers you and 
  which makes you envy others who possess it, work to develop it.</p>
