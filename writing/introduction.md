**Introduction**

Long Letters is an online collection of my writing, past projects and bio.

In January 2018 I decided that regularly writing my thoughts down might be a good way of maintaining clarity in my life. I enjoy writing clearly and I love reading clear writing.

I know very little but am curious about the world around me. Collecting and acting on wisdom from those older than me has thus far seemed to improve the quality of my life. I don't agree with all this wisdom but it has thus far been true that, like an ant carrying food, each individual piece of wisdom carries heavy insight for its light, succint form. 

I will collect slivers of wisdom on this website and occasionally add thoughts of my own. The website will be messy at times and highly organized at others. Organization will change as my thoughts do. There will, of course be a time lag (which may sometimes be significant).

For as long as I live, I hope to share wisdom I think will be valuable for my (future) children. By focusing on the things that I think are valuable enough to explain to my (future) children, I hope to develop a clear understanding of the things that matter most to me.

This website is available for anyone to visit. I don't anticipate many people will visit, but I hope that those who do enjoy themselves.

***Introduction: Old Version 1***

Long Letters is an online collection of my writing, past projects and bio.

In January 2018 I decided that regularly writing my thoughts down might be a good way of maintaining clarity in my life. I enjoy writing clearly and I love reading clear writing.

Almost ten years before, I had read and watched The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch. Randy was a father, a husband and a Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. He was diagnosed with terminal cancer in September 2017 and told that he had 3-6 months to live. Just a month later, he presented a lecture called "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams". This lecture came to be known as 'The Last Lecture' and was also published as a book.

Randy Pausch only had a month to summarize his thoughts and ideas into The Last Lecture. He included in his lecture what he thought would be most valuable for his children.

I've been blessed with more time. For as long as I live, I hope to write clearly about things I think will be valuable for my (future) children.

By focusing on the things that I think are valuable enough to explain to my (future) children, I hope to develop a clear understanding of the things that matter most to me.

I hypothesize that this exercise will hone my ability to approach life with clarity. Should this happen, I hope that I can use this gift to assist others.

This website is available for anyone to visit. I don't anticipate many people will visit, but I hope that those who do enjoy themselves :).
