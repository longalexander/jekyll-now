  <p>I'm a Software Engineer at <a href='https://workwhilejobs.com/' target='_blank'>WorkWhile</a>. We're building an online marketplace that makes hourly labor on-demand and scalable for employers while providing workers with stable income and unmatched benefits. This will be a new way for hourly workers to earn a better living and live better lives.</p>

  <p>I love taking ideas from conception to reality. There's something magical about the process: nurturing thoughts into actionable ideas, navigating the strategy maze, returning undercooked ideas to the stove, struggling through different approaches, and cooking up a sustained, impactful experience.</p>
