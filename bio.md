I’m a student at [Stanford University]{http://stanford.edu) expected to graduate in June 2019 with a B.S. in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/). I've lived in the United States, the United Kingdom and Malaysia. Most recently, I worked at the [Human Computer Interaction](http://hci.stanford.edu/) lab on campus.

I love the feeling that clarity brings. I like spending time helping others feel this too. I strive for clear thinking, even though it can be time and enery consuming in the short term.

Time with family and friends makes me happy. I also enjoy regularly reading The Daily Mail, struggling through problem sets and code, watching commercials, listening to Blue Planet II, grappling with difficult concepts, writing clearly and learning about the people I meet.

I’ve been told I’m friendly and I’m happy to help so do get in touch if you'd like :).

**Long Letters**

Long Letters is an online collection of my writing, past projects and bio. 

In January 2018 I decided that regularly writing my thoughts down might be a good way of maintaining clarity in my life. I enjoy writing clearly and I love reading clear writing. Almost ten years before, I had [read](https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/book/) and [watched](https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/videos/index.html) The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch. 

For those who haven't had a chance to read/watch The Last Lecture, Randy Pausch was a father, a husband and a Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. He was diagnosed with terminal cancer in September 2017 and told that he had 3-6 months to live. Just a month later, he presented a lecture called "[Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams](https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/videos/index.html)". This lecture came to be known as 'The Last Lecture' and was also published as a [book](https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/book/index.html). If you haven't already, I highly encourage you to [watch the lecture](https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/videos/index.html) and/or [read the book](https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/book/index.html).

Randy Pausch had a month to summarize his thoughts and ideas into The Last Lecture. I've been blessed with more time and I intend to use it. For as long as I live, I hope to write clearly about things I think will be valuable for my (future) children. By focusing on these things, I hope to gain clarity and, possibly, help others gain clarity too.

This website is available for anyone to visit. I don't anticipate many people will visit, but I hope that those who do enjoy themselves :).

**Volumes**

My opinions will change over time. Every few years, I will place all the writing that exists at that time in a secure place. This will be a volume of the book. I will then continue to write on the website for another few years until I decide that the time has come to create another volume. For example, when I am 23 I will take all the writing on this website and put it in a secure place. The writing will be placed in a folder labeled "Long Letters: Volume 1: 21-23 years of age". Then I will continue to write on the website. When I turn 25, I might decide to create another volume. I will then take all the writing on the website and put it in a secure place. The writing will be placed in a folder labeled "Long Letters: Volume 2: 23-25 years of age". I will repeat this process till I have completely stopped writing.

**Some history**

When I was a child, my mother and I would talk about writing a book some day in the future. It would be a book about the lessons she taught me. Many of the lessons she taught me feature in my writing. So, she deserves much of the credit for anything valuable I write.
