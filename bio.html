<h2>Bio</h2>
<div class="infobox">
  <p>Iâ€™m a student expecting to graduate from <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a> in June 2019 with a B.S. in 
    <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu">Symbolic Systems</a>. 

  <p>I am blessed to have been born into a family that emphasizes the importance of wisdom. Practical wisdom has helped me navigate some of the most difficult periods of my life. I'm not dependent on wisdom, but it is certainly a fantastic reference that helps decision making.</p>

  <p>I intend to one day pass on the wisdom I've learned to those who come after me. Life can be tough and I've found it a comfort to have a guide.</p>

  <p>Alex</p>
