  <p>I believe that internalizing the wisdom of others makes my life more fulfilling.</p>

  <p>First, I would like to help my children lead fulfilling lives. One way I can help is by collecting wisdom for them to learn. The short quotes below might provide answers, spark curiosity, or lead them to explore new ideas.</p>

  <p>Second, I would also like to help those I share the world with enjoy the wisdom that has helped me. For this reason, this collection is hosted on a publically accessible website.</p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy the collection. If you have any questions or additions feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:alexanderlong@stanford.edu">alexanderlong@stanford.edu<a/></p>
