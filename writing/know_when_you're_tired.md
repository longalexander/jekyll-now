**Know when you're tired**

I'm writing this note because I should have gone to bed an hour and a half ago. This is how things often go when I'm tired:

1) I often try to do mentally intensive things but are slow to understand things as I'm tired and should really just go to bed.
2) I stop focusing on the tasks I've prioritised and am easily distracted.
3) The things that distract me keep me up even longer.
4) The next morning I tell myself that I will be better at knowing when I am tired.

This series of events repeats itself when I get very tired. The effects of tiredness also compound making the situation worse as time passes.

Here's a solution to the problem:

Have a set, calendared bedtime.
