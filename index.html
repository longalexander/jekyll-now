    <p>"I saw more of Lyell than any other man both before and after my marriage. His mind was characterized, as it appeared to me, by 
      clearness, caution, sound judgement and a good deal or originality. When I made any remark to him on Geology, he never rested until 
      he saw the whole case clearly and often made me see it more clearly than I had done before. He would advance all possible objections 
      to my suggestion; and even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious."</p>

    "Well structured, narrative text is what we're after rather than just text. If someone builds a list of bullet points in word, that 
    would be just as bad as powerpoint. The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than "writing" a 20 page powerpoint is because 
    the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how 
    things are related. Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative 
    importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas."

  <h4>Ideas</h4>
  <div class = "infobox">
  "Steve used to say to me — and he used to say this a lot — “Hey Jony, here’s a dopey idea.”
  <br>
  <br>
  And sometimes they were. Really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room and 
  they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet simple ones, which in their subtlety, their detail, 
  they were utterly profound.
  <br>
  <br>
  And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. 
  You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed 
  thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished."
