**Know when you're tired**

I'm writing this note because I should have gone to bed an hour and a half ago. This is how things often go when I'm tired:

1) I often try to do mentally intensive things but am slow to understand things as I'm tired and should really just go to bed.<br>
2) I stop focusing on the tasks I've prioritised and am easily distracted.<br>
3) The things that distract me keep me up even longer.<br>
4) The next morning I tell myself that I will be better at knowing when I am tired.<br>

This series of events repeats itself when I get very tired. The effects of tiredness compound making the situation worse each time it occurs.

Here's are some possible solutions to the problem that seem to work:

- Have a set, calendared bedtime and make it a habit to stick to it.

- Have a list of things that are productive and enjoyable, but not a priority, that you can do when you're tired. For instance, I'm in a fairly inspirational mood so I'm using the time to codify my thoughts instead of mindlessly scrolling through The Daily Mail for the 3rd time in 15 minutes.

- Your friends' bedtimes may influence yours. If your bodies work in similar ways, this can be ideal. If they don't, one may need to identify that there is a choice between spending more time with friends and resting. So far, I've found that good friends are understanding of my need to rest and are happy to work around my needs. If I am well rested, I can be a better friend.
