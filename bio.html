<h2>Bio</h2>
<div class="infobox">
  <p>I’m a student at <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a> expected to graduate in June 2019 with a B.S. in 
    <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu">Symbolic Systems</a>. 
    Last summer, I worked at the <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/">Human Computer Interaction</a> lab on campus. I am currently working on 
    a self-directed project that seeks to investigate how <a href="https://prologis.com">Prologis'</a> 10-Ks changed between 2012-2014. 
  This work will build on the case studies <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=25943">"The AMB Consolidation"</a>
    and <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/case-studies/amb-property-corporation-navigating-treacherous-waters">"AMB Property Corporation: Navigating Treacherous Waters"</a>.</p> 

  <p>I love the feeling that clarity brings. I like spending time helping others feel this too. Striving for clear thinking is central to 
    who I am. It can be time and energy consuming in the short term, but I am placing bets on the long term.</p>

  <p>Time with family and friends makes me happy. I also enjoy regularly reading The Daily Mail, struggling through problem sets and code, 
    satiating curiosity about the environments we build, watching commercials, listening to powerful music, singing, 
    grappling with difficult concepts, writing clearly and learning about the people I meet. </p>

  <p>I collect wisdom I'd like to share with my future children. Please click <a href="http://www.longletters.com">here</a> 
    if this interests you.</p>
  
  <p>I attempt to live by a small number of principles. I find them helpful in my own life, they may not be helpful for yours. 
    Life is rarely black and white, but sometimes rules help to enable improvements I'd like to make. Please click <a href="http://www.longletters.com/principles">here</a> 
    if this interests you.</p></p>

  <p>I’ve been told I’m friendly and I’m happy to help so do get in touch if you'd like :).</p>

  <p>Alex</p>
