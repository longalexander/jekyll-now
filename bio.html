<h2>Bio</h2>
<div class="infobox">
  <p>Iâ€™m a student expecting to graduate from <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a> in June 2019 with a B.S. in 
    <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu">Symbolic Systems</a>. 

  <p>This website primarily exists because I've found that writing down, and revisiting, wisdom helps keeps me on the straight and narrow.</p>

  <p>I also plan to use this site as a repository for teaching materials in the future. I'm working on a paper/book that will help beginners understand REIT financial statements that are submitted to the SEC. I believe that a strong understanding of financial statements is necessary to understand a business. I think it's unfortunate (and dangerous) that many people don't understand businesses. One reason many people don't understand financial statements may be that there's too much friction in learning the terminology and accounting nuances. I hope to smooth out these bumps in the road and am using Prologis (NYSE:PLD) as an illustrative case study. </p>

  <p>Best,
  <br>Alex</br></p>
